As a staff,
I can check and give out the queue for the arrived customer 
so that I can do other useful works. 


As a customer,
I can be in the line without being present there 
so that I can go elsewhere to do other stuffs.


As a staff,
I can skip the queue if the customer doesn't arrive on time
so that the waiting time will be reduced.
