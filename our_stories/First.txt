As a staff,
I can check and give out the queue for the arrived customer 
so that I can do other useful works. 

1. The product shall display the the remaining queue to the staff and customers.
2. The product shall scan the barcode of the entry ticket (no duplicate).
3. The product shall stop giving queue if it exceeds the limit.


As a customer,
I can be in the line without being present there 
so that I can go elsewhere to do other stuffs.

1. The product shall remind the customer when it's nearly their queue.
2. The product shall notify if the queue is being skipped.
3. The product shall display the queue of other playthings.


As a staff,
I can skip the queue if the customer doesn't arrive on time

2. The product shall update the queue within seconds.
3. The product shall limit the customer to queue only one thing at a time.
